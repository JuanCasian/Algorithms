Time complexit= O(n * 2) ; where is the length of the array
	- Becuase in the worst case which is the array is sorted backwards I would need to go throught the array
		twice, one in the front and then other going back to put the elements

Space Complexity = O(1) ;
	- Because no more memory was used and the array was passed as a pointer
